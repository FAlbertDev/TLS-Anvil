# TLS-Test-Framework

The TLS-Test-Framework powers the [TLS-Testsuite](https://github.com/RUB-NDS/TLS-Testsuite) and was developed as part of the master's thesis *Development and Evaluation of a TLS-Testsuite* at the *Ruhr-University Bochum* in cooperation with the *TÃœV Inormationstechnik GmbH*.

The framework provides JUnit extensions, annotations and an API for modeling tests for the TLS protocol. It uses the TLS stack of [TLS-Attacker](https://github.com/RUB-NDS/TLS-Attacker) for the execution of handshake workflows that are defined in test cases.
