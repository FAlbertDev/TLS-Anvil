Note that TLS 1.3 servers might receive TLS 1.2 or prior ClientHellos which contain other compression methods and (if negotiating such a prior version) MUST follow the procedures for the appropriate prior version of TLS.

Each party MUST send a "close_notify" alert before closing its write side of the connection, unless it has already sent some error alert.

In compatibility mode (see Appendix D.4), this field MUST be non-empty, so a client not offering a pre-TLS 1.3 session MUST generate a new 32-byte value.  This value need not be random but SHOULD be unpredictable to avoid implementations fixating on a specific value (also known as ossification). Otherwise, it MUST be set as a zero-length vector (i.e., a zero-valued single byte length field).
